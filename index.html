            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>I am a junior at the University of Central Florida. My major is Digital Media on the Web Design track and my minor is Computer Science.
                I am from Boston, Massachusetts and my family currently resides there. I decided to go to school out of state because I wanted to live somewhere warmer
                and experience new things in life. <br><br>Some of my hobbies include shopping, traveling, spending time with my friends, trying new foods, and relaxing at home with my dog, Coco.

                    <h4>PRE - COLLEGE</h4>
                    <p>Before choosing UCF, I went to high school at the Academy for Science and Design. 
                        This was a small charter school that specialized in STEM. My high school did not 
                        get a lot of funding, therefore they did not have any sports and not many clubs. 
                        I felt like I never got a real high school experience and most of my free time 
                        went into school or work. Due to the lack of social events at my high school, I 
                        did very well in school and finished as the third of my class. My high school 
                        also required their students to choose a study of specialization in STEM and we 
                        had to take extra classes in that field. At the time, Computer Science fascinated 
                        me the most and this was when I realized I wanted to purse a career in this field. 
                        <br><br>I chose UCF because I wanted a drastic change in my life and I wanted to 
                        experience being a student at a large school. I’ve always wanted to go out of 
                        state for college and I knew that Florida was perfect for me. Sometimes I get 
                        homesick and I miss my family, but I have always been an independent individual 
                        so I knew I was capable of making this big move. </p>

            </div>
            <p>FRESHMAN YEAR<br><br>I experienced many new life changes during my Freshman year at UCF. I moved from 
                Boston, Massachusetts to Orlando, Florida and this was the farthest away I’ve ever 
                been from home. It took some time for me to adjust to the new environment and not 
                feel homesick. I was originally a Computer Science major, however, after my first 
                Fall semester, I realized it wasn’t what I wanted to pursue. I had a passion for 
                design, specifically through technology. I discovered Digital Media to be the perfect 
                major for me and I continued to keep Computer Science as my minor to enhance my 
                programing skills. Also, all my classes were online because I began college in 2020. 
                These online classes made it possible for me to be in school while being anywhere in 
                the world. I was able to travel to New Orleans, Cancun, and many new cities in Florida 
                during my Freshman year.</p>

            <p>SOPHOMORE YEAR<br><br>Unfortunately due to COVID-19, I didn’t get to meet many 
                people during my first year of college. I decided to join a sorority at UCF to 
                meet more people. I joined Kappa Delta at the beginning of my Sophomore year 
                and this was a great experience to create friendships and build networking 
                connections. I had the opportunity to give back to many organizations and 
                participate in fundraisers for other clubs and groups within UCF. For instance, 
                I was part of the Zeta Lip Sync event to fundraise for Breast Cancer Awareness. 
                Additionally, I fulfilled my dream of purchasing and owning a dog. I bought my 
                dog, Coco, this year and this decision has drastically changed my life. </p>

            <p>JUNIOR YEAR<br><br>At the beginning of my Junior year, I began working at a 
                golf course as a beverage cart attendant. I believe this job has benefitted 
                me because I am now a morning person (due to the 6 AM shifts) and I have became 
                more productive with my goals. I decided to no longer be a part of Kappa Delta 
                because I wanted to prioritize my time on school and work. I took a second job 
                as a nail salon receptionist as well. In my Junior year, I learned time 
                management and to spend time with the people I most care for, rather than have 
                superficial friendships. I was able to travel to the Bahamas with my boyfriend 
                and go on many adventures with my best friends. For the rest of my Junior year, 
                I hope on beginning my Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis and find an 
                internship to gain more experience in Digital Media. </p>

                    <h6>FUTURE PLANS</h6>
                    <p>For my second semester of Junior year I intend on beginning my Honors Undergraduate 
                        Thesis. This thesis will take about two semesters to complete and I plan on 
                        finishing in Fall 2023. I also hope to get an internship for Web Design/Development 
                        in Summer 2023. I want to gain work experience in the field to be prepared for when 
                        I graduate. I am on track to graduate at UCF in Spring 2024 and I plan on staying in 
                        Florida afterwards. I am unsure about what city I will live in, however, it depends 
                        on where my future job is. I hope to work for a technology company as a Web Developer 
                        or UX/UI Developer. </p>
