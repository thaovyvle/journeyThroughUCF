# Project Task:

Design a single-page website that describes your journey through UCF. This will be a responsive site that works on at least 3 screen sizes and has its CSS generated by a SASS page. It will include:

• HTML content that tells about you as a designer and student.

• CSS styling appropriate for the content and grid with media queries to adjust the width.

• Properly formatted SASS page which you process into a CSS page.

​

# My Approach:

In this project, I created a single-page responsive website with HTML, Javascript, and CSS generated by SASS. The website encapsulates my journey at UCF, featuring distinct sections such as about me, pre-college, my experience each year at UCF, and my future plans. Grids and media queries were utilized for the different layouts throughout the page. Additionally, I created and designed all the content within the website.
